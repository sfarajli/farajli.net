Here are some of the programs I use, recommend and some I dislike.
You can get my configuration for most of these programs [here](https://git.farajli.net/slcf.git).

### Criteria
For software to be usable for me it has to be:
1. Free and Open-source
1. Uncomplicated, simple to use
1. Lightweight
1. Fast

### Operating systems
* [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org): The best linux distro for most people, since installing packages is very convenient using the AUR and has a great wiki.
* [Gentoo](https://gentoo.org): Unique operating system with a proper wiki, see my [post](../posts/gentoo.html) about it.
* [Void](https://voidlinux.org): Great linux distros free from filthy systemd and glibc.
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/): Easy to install and use, the best distro for beginners.
* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/): Simple operating system with a clean and elegant codebase.
* <a href="https://ubuntu.com" class=orange_text>Ubuntu</a>: Debian done wrong with snaps.
* <a href="https://manjaro.org" class=orange_text>Manjaro</a>: Same as ubuntu except even worse doesn't even work properly.
* <span class=orange_text>MacOS</span>: BSD done wrong, with apple garbage.
* <span class=orange_text>Windows</span>: Graphical trash.

### Programming languages
* C: Portable assembly, basically the default programming language for unix.
* Go: Modern version of C, very convenient and safe to write programs in.
* Posix Shell: Concise and convenient for scripts and small programs.
* <strong class=orange_text>C++</strong>: Bloated, not safe and a mess, literally every bad piece of software I've ever used was written in C++.

### Window managers
* [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org): At first a little hard to configure but at the end totally worth it.
* [BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm): Best static window manager, easy to configure with and an extraordinary tool called bspc.
* [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/): An average window manager, good for beginners.

### Text editors
* vim and [nvim](https://neovim.io/): Just way too convenient to be real.
* <span class=orange_text>JetBrains IDEs</span>: Bloated, heavy, overcomplicated and costs money(?).

### Browser
* [Qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/): Has vim-keybinds making it very convenient to use.
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/): Sometimes, you need a bloated browser to view bloated sites.

### Terminal and terminal Utilities
* [st](https://st.suckless.org/): Terminal emulator though a little hard to configure.
* [alacritty](https://alacritty.org/): Terminal emulator which works perfectly fine without any configuration.
* [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/): Music player.
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/): Interactive shell.
* [dash](http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/): Shell script interpreter.
* [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf): File manager.
* [translate-shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell): Cli translator.

### Xorg utilities
* [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/): Interactive menu to select items.
* [slstatus](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/): Status monitor.
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/): Media player.
* [nsxiv](https://nsxiv.codeberg.page/): Image viewer.
* [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/): pdf viewer.

### Other
* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org): Document converter.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system.

### About hardware
I don't really care about hardware because it is easily replacable and I am fine with whatever just works,
as long as it not overpriced. If you use proper software any hardware should get the job done.

I am not going to shill thinkpads like everyone else, though I think they are fine, to me only 2 things
set apart thinkpads from all the other laptops, firstly, the fact that they are librebootable and, secondly,
they are really cheap.
