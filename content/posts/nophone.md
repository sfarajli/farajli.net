### Why I absolutely hate smartphones.

For the past few years, the question that I have been asked the most
is that "why don't you use a smartphone", but I've never really 
answered any of those questions, even though, 
I do have different reasons not to use one.

The main point is that if you ever use any sort of properly
designed "normal" operating systems and hardware you can't really 
go back and use garbage computer operating systems or phones
without getting disgusted. 
With smartphones, it is even worse than toy-like computer OSes like windows
or mac, because with those systems you at least get some sort of 
proper hardware components like a keyboard, 
a monitor with "normal" screen ratio and so on.
But with phones, not only you get an operating system that is no better than 
trash, but also some very cringe way to interact with the hardware. 
(Yes, I am talking about sensor screens.)

Now, let's talk about why

- Operating systems
- Package Management
- User space applications
- Hardware
- Privacy and Security
Absolutely suck on "smart" phones.

### Operating Systems
There are 2 main OSes for phones: iOS and Android, there are also some not widely used ones 
like legacy Windows Phone and even some open-source ones, though here, I shall only talk about the
first 2 that I have mentioned, but that should also be somewhat relevant 
to almost all the other phone OSes as well.

**Android Sucks**! because, you can't even perform the most basic
computer functionalities 
like compiling very simple software, writing scripts, and so on, you don't even have
the root access to the phone you "own", but the company that sold you that has full 
access to the phone over the internet, that is basically like slavery with extra steps, lol.
Some people might say "Well, that is not a computer
you are not supposed to compile programs and write scripts!" I don't buy that argument
because, in reality, computers and phones are indeed the same thing, the way that they
function is the same, the way they connect with other computers is the same,
they use the same technologies to function (in fact, Android uses the Linux kernel).
The difference between properly written computer OSes and android is that 
computer OSes care about the users while phones are trying to keep you under control.
It is also worth mentioning that I am not talking about the pure open source Android
project, I am talking about Android, on which companies put a load of garbage to make 
it more "beneficial" for the company.  

With iPhones, it's the same thing except it is even worse, 
it should be obvious why, apple! the single worst company 
that has ever existed, Apple is trying so hard to keep you 
inside of its garbage-like "ecosystem" by making it very hard 
and even sometimes impossible to connect with hardware/software
other than Apple's, and all these ***morons*** will be like 
> "BuT, DuuuuuDe, APpLE DeVIces WeRk WItH oTher AppLE DeViCes sO SMoOthLy" 
Yeah, by making it impossible to work with basically everything else
and you have to have apple garbage all around you.

### Package Management
Android and iOS do have some sort of package management,
on Android, it's Play store (But you can also install packages using .apk format)
on iOS, you have app store.  
Google owns Play Store, and you have to have a google account to be able to use 
Play Store (which on Android you basically also have to), on iOS, Apple owns
app store.   
That might not seem like a huge deal, but it is. It basically means Google and Apple
have all the control of the programs uploaded to Play Store and app store respectively,
meaning that Google and Apple can block and even change the source code of some programs,
inject absolutely anything inside them.  
Those companies need profit no matter what, meaning they would do anything to 
get profit, even unethical stuff, and you are the one who let them do that to you.

### User Space applications
By user space applications, I mean just the programs that people
install on smartphones. Frankly speaking, those programs are
just for normies who don't understand 
technology and advances users are completely ignored. Phone programs
are graphical, thus they use more ram and cpu and most of the time they are
full of advertisements (Xiaomi Phones even have ads in the system's gallery).
They are not privacy-respecting, bloated, and kind of useless. 
There is one program, however, that is worth talking about separately, and that is 
"WhatsApp". It is the most widely used messaging application, though it has absolutely
nothing extraordinary and some stuff that is even worse than an average messaging program.
Here are some bad stuff about it:

- WhatsApp is not private, **at all**!
- You have to have a smartphone and a phone number.

Imagine a piece of software requires you to have a phone to be able to use it,
that is basically like saying that a $400  device is a dependency of that program,
this is absolutely *nuts*. I find it quite absurd
that people don't find it absurd. 
> If a program as simple as a messaging app requires you to have
> a cell phone, you shouldn't even be using that,
> no matter how many people around you use it!

### Hardware
Hardware of cellphones absolutely suck they are designed to be broken so easily you can
break them by accident, that is, of course, 
to sell more of them, they are nothing like old classic solid Nokia phones 
with buttons and stuff, instead you have only a screen and you touch on it 
which is very very cringe.  
I just want buttons to press, not touchscreens to touch.  
Another thing is that you can't upgrade your RAM or your storage and you're supposed to use overpriced
services like iCloud or Google Drive.

### Privacy and security
Privacy just doesn't exist on smartphones; that is just a matter of fact.
If you use an iPhone, all your photos are sent to Apple servers and can be hacked 
(though not quite probable) since, they are not stored only on your local system
which makes it less secure as well,
On Android, people use Google Photos, which is basically as bad as iPhones.

### Health
Phones are also bad for your health, I can't
tell you the specifics since I am not a doctor.
But it is common knowledge that phones are bad for you.

### Good stuff about phones
The only good thing about a phone is its camera. 
though many people take too many useless pictures
resulting in a mess of data. Nonetheless, cameras are very useful
but it is not worth it to use a smartphone just because of that.

### Summing it up
Smartphones are useless pieces of garbage that are overpriced, not privacy respecting and 
meant for normies who don't understand how technology
works, or at least how it should work, ***no offense***.
Even if you must use a smartphone, that doesn't change the fact that they are 
bad for you.
