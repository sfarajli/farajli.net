I have a website!
-----------------

As of June 13th 2024, the best website on the internet has officially been created.  

This site is not made by using one of those fancy and bloated site generators
or any garbage like that, it was created, quite surprisingly, by writing HTML and
CSS, like it is supposed to be, though it is a little inefficient, error-prone
and a pain writing HTML and adding boilerplate code to each file,
thus it's quite probable that I shall write a small program to do that automatically
for me in the future, but that program wouldn't be the same as bloated site generators,
in fact, it'd basically be the same as manual way of writing HTML.  
Here are some of the advantages of my website compared to a lot of contemporary ones.  

* Doesn't fill your entire ram
* Doesn't have ads, tracker or unnecessary JavaScript
* Loads <strong class="color1">Fast</strong>!
  
As of now, there isn't that much of content here, but I will probably add a lot more.
